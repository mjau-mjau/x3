### Diagnostics

If there are critical issues noted on the initial page-load, you should try to resolve them. If there are no critical issues, you can navigate to your X3 PANEL [yourwebsite.com/panel] settings > advanced and disable diagnostics.



### First steps

Once your X3 application is working, you can start setting it up. First, you may wish to use the STYLER interface (accessible from a button at bottom right of your X3 website) to review combinations of skins, colors, fonts and layouts. You can also start editing settings and creating pages from your X3 panel [yourwebsite.com/panel]. The X3 panel includes in-context help links which will help you on your way.
